Setup:

Import necessary libraries.
Load your OpenAI API key from a .env file.
Initialize conversation_history to maintain context.
get_chatbot_response:

Appends the user's message to the history.
Calls the OpenAI API (openai.ChatCompletion.create) with:
The chosen GPT model.
The full conversation history (for better responses).
A temperature parameter controlling randomness (lower is more deterministic).
Extracts the chatbot's response from the API result and updates conversation history.
Returns the chatbot's response.
main:

Provides a simple chat interface:
Takes user input.
Checks for the 'exit' keyword.
Calls get_chatbot_response to get the chatbot's reply.
Prints the response.
Script Execution:

If run directly (python script_name.py), the main function starts the chat loop.
Key Improvements to Consider:

Knowledge Base: Integrate a knowledge base (FAQ documents, IT manuals) for the chatbot to reference when answering. This can be done using techniques like Langchain or embedding-based search.
Custom Prompts: Design prompts to guide the chatbot's behavior (e.g., "You are an IT help desk assistant...").
Error Handling: Handle potential API errors or exceptions gracefully.
User Authentication: If needed, implement user authentication for personalized assistance and tracking.
Ticket Creation: Allow the chatbot to create IT support tickets if it can't solve an issue.
GUI: Build a user-friendly graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or web frameworks.
